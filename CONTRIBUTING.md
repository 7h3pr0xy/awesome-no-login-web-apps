# Contributing

Hey, thanks for considering contributing to this list. I really appreciate it. 

Please follow the following guidelines when submitting a PR -

* Read the introduction in README and make sure your addition(s) are valid for this awesome list. 
* Description about links should give an account of the outstanding features and major short-coming of the item, if any.
* Description should end without a full-stop.
* New categories can be created if and when needed.
* Add a `[Account]` type listing only when there is no comparable alternative available that works without login.

And if you are in doubt, don't hesitate to open an issue and we will talk over it. 

Thanks
