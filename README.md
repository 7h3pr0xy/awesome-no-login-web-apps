A list of awesome web softwares. 
[Softwares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_software) ([Application Softwares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software)) are things that you install on your computer to get the job done. This list presents web alternatives for as many as those softwares. 

From Wikipedia:

> An application program (app or application for short) is a computer program designed to perform a group of coordinated functions, tasks, or activities for the benefit of the user. Examples of an application include a word processor, a spreadsheet, an accounting application, a web browser, a media player, an aeronautical flight simulator, a console game or a photo editor.

Websites that require registration have only been included if they provide much more features with respect to sites without registration.
They have been tagged with `[Account]` in this list.
